/**
 * Vendored from Knock — ../Knock, commit 8592cc6.
 *
 * A copy rather than a dependency, and not by preference: `knock-audio` is not
 * published to npm, and a `file:../Knock` dependency cannot survive the Docker
 * build, whose context is this directory alone. So this is a fork with a date
 * on it. **Fix bugs upstream in Knock first**, then re-copy — a change made
 * only here is a change the next copy silently reverts.
 *
 * Unmodified. `tests/knock.test.js` exercises it against Noggin's own room
 * codes, which is the seam that matters: the payload format demands exactly
 * four printable ASCII bytes, and Noggin's codes are exactly that by accident
 * of a different decision made for different reasons.
